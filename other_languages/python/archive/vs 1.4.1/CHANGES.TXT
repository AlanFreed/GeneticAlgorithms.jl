Moved experimental data from the genAlg object to the species.specie object.
The parameter in element [0] holds the power in the objective function.

A port into python of the author's genetic algorithm originally written in 
oberon, then ported to zonnon, and then ported to pascal.  Yes, the is the
fourth language I written various versions of this genetic algorithm in.  Over
the years, it algorithm has refined, features added and others removed, as 
my experiences evolved and my needs and the capabilitis of a genetic algorithm 
came into better focus. 

The last version number of the pascal software was: 1.3.3, so the initial 
python version number was set at 1.4.0.  The pascal version of genAlg was
licensed GUN Lesser General Public License.  The python version carries an
MIT license, which is very similiar in its intent and the common licensing 
of python projects.
